Hello! Glad you could be here.
This is a project for a school project that I made because I couldnt think of anything better.
I used a crowdsourced data API to train the AI, with some help from Groq to throw it all together.
It is being hosted on my pc (with 32GB of RAM, A Ryzen 5 7600X and an RX 9060 XT, if you were wondering).

If you have any suggestions or notice any issues, feel free to submit an issue (top left corner, right underneath aarhonn).
